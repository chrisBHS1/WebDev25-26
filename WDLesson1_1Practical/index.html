    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p1>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages and their content. It uses a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, which web browsers interpret to display content in a structured layout. HTML provides the basic structure for every website, and is typically used in conjunction with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity.  </p1>

<hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
    <h3>CCS</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p1>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. It's a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p1>

    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p1>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language primarily known for its role in creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (for structuring content) and CSS (for styling content).</p1>

    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
    <h5>Bonus</h5>
    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
    <p1>Bootstrap is not a programming language but a free and open-source front-end framework that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites. Its purpose is to help developers create modern, responsive, and mobile-first websites faster and more efficiently by providing a large collection of reusable components. These components include pre-designed templates for navigation bars, buttons, forms, and a powerful grid system, which allows websites to automatically adapt to different screen sizes. </p1>
